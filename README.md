# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits

Digit dataset is used in this project and support vector machine algorithm will detect handwritten digits.

.fit() is used to train our model and .predict() will predict the digits.

This algorithm proves that it is fast and efficent when it comes to training and predicting.
